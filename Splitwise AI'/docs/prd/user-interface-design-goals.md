# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create an intuitive conversational interface that feels like chatting with a knowledgeable Brazilian friend who understands local culture and payment habits. The experience should be so natural that users focus on describing their situation rather than learning the app. Prioritize conversation flow over traditional app navigation, with minimal UI chrome and maximum focus on the chat interface.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Conversation-First**: Primary interaction through natural language input with smart suggestions
- **Contextual Confirmations**: Visual summaries of divisions with one-tap approval workflows  
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Interface learns and adapts to user patterns and preferences
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: UI elements and language that reflect Brazilian communication styles
- **Payment Integration**: Seamless integration with PIX and other Brazilian payment preferences

## Core Screens and Views

- **Main Chat Interface**: Primary conversation view with expense processing
- **Division Summary**: Visual breakdown of calculated splits with payment details
- **Group Management**: Create and manage recurring groups and member preferences  
- **Profile Settings**: Personal preferences, payment methods, and privacy controls
- **History View**: Past divisions and group interactions for reference
- **Onboarding Flow**: Welcome experience explaining conversational approach
