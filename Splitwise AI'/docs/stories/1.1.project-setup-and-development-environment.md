## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in Epic 1, establishing the foundation for all subsequent development.

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Monorepo structure with Turborepo for build optimization
- Apps directory containing web app with Next.js frontend + API routes
- Packages directory for shared types, UI components, and configuration
- Specific folder organization: components/, services/, stores/, middleware/, utils/, types/
- Infrastructure directory for Terraform configurations targeting Brazilian AWS regions

### Technology Stack Requirements  
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14.0.4 with TypeScript 5.3.3, Tailwind CSS 3.3.6
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui 0.8.0 for accessible, customizable components
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4.7 for lightweight conversation state
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase 15.1 in Brazilian regions
- **Cache**: Redis 7.0 for conversation context and Claude cost optimization
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth 2.64.4 with LGPD compliance
- **AI Integration**: @anthropic-ai/sdk 0.9.1 for Claude API access
- **Build Tools**: Turbo 1.11.2, Webpack 5.89.0 (Next.js bundled)
- **Monitoring**: Pino 8.16.2 for structured logging with Brazilian timestamp format

### Environment Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- Brazilian-specific environment variables: TIMEZONE=America/Sao_Paulo, CURRENCY=BRL, LOCALE=pt-BR
- LGPD compliance variables: DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=90, DPO_EMAIL, PRIVACY_POLICY_URL
- Database connection via Supabase with service role key for backend operations
- Redis URL for local development: redis://localhost:6379
- Anthropic API key for Claude integration
- Development environment setup with pnpm and fnm for Node.js 20.10.0

### Development Workflow Standards
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
Required development commands to implement:
- `pnpm dev` - Start all services (frontend + API)
- `pnpm test` - Run comprehensive test suite
- `pnpm build` - Production build
- `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` - Code quality tools
- `pnpm type-check` - TypeScript validation
- Supabase setup commands: `pnpm supabase:setup`, `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm db:seed`

### Critical Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Type sharing: All shared types in `packages/shared/src/types`, import via `@racha-ai/shared/types`
- Environment variable access: Only through config objects (`@/config/*`), never direct `process.env`
- API calls: Always use service layer (`@/services/*`) for consistent error handling
- Brazilian formatting: Use shared utilities for currency (R$), dates, phone numbers
- LGPD compliance: All user data operations must include retention and consent validation
- Database queries: Use repository pattern with Supabase client, no raw SQL in API routes

### File Locations Based on Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Main app: `apps/web/src/app/` for App Router pages
- API routes: `apps/web/src/app/api/` for serverless edge functions
- Components: `apps/web/src/components/` with subdirectories (ui/, conversation/, auth/)
- Services: `apps/web/src/services/` for API client services  
- Configuration: `packages/config/` for shared ESLint, TypeScript, Tailwind configs
- Shared types: `packages/shared/src/types/` for TypeScript interfaces
- Environment template: `.env.example` in project root

### Architecture Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- Vercel Edge Network deployment with SÃ£o Paulo edge optimization
- Brazilian region compliance (AWS sa-east-1) for all data services
- Cost-optimized Claude AI routing: 70% Haiku, 25% Sonnet, 5% Opus
- Multi-layer caching strategy: Redis + Vercel edge for <1.5s response times
- LGPD-compliant data residency in Brazilian AWS regions
- Support for 200+ concurrent users through intelligent caching

### Testing

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest 29.7.0 + React Testing Library 14.1.2 for component testing
- **Backend Testing**: Jest 29.7.0 + Supertest 6.3.3 for API and service testing  
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.40.1 for Brazilian user flow testing
- Test files should be organized in `apps/web/tests/` directory
- Testing must include Claude integration validation and cost optimization verification
- Accessibility validation required for conversation interface components
