# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

• Transform traditional bill-splitting into natural Portuguese/English conversation
• Achieve 80% reduction in interaction time vs traditional apps like Splitwise  
• Deliver LGPD-compliant AI processing with full user control and transparency
• Support Brazilian cultural contexts (PIX, regional expressions, social patterns)
• Enable intelligent group memory and pattern recognition for recurring users
• Provide reliable Claude-powered expense processing with smart model distribution
• Launch MVP within 6-8 weeks targeting 50-200 simultaneous users

## Background Context

RachaAI addresses the friction of traditional bill-splitting apps by replacing complex forms and buttons with natural conversation in Portuguese Brazilian. Unlike existing solutions that require users to learn app-specific workflows, RachaAI lets users simply describe their situation: "Acabei de pagar R$ 180 no jantar. Éramos 4 pessoas: eu, Maria, João e Ana. Mas a Maria só bebeu água, então ela paga menos 20 reais." The Claude AI processes this naturally, understanding Brazilian cultural contexts, payment preferences, and group dynamics while maintaining full LGPD compliance and user privacy control.

The current bill-splitting market relies on traditional form-based interfaces that require multiple taps, selections, and manual calculations. Brazilian users particularly struggle with apps designed for international markets that don't understand local payment methods (PIX), cultural contexts (rodízio, happy hour), or regional expressions. RachaAI eliminates this friction by making expense division as natural as describing it to a friend.
